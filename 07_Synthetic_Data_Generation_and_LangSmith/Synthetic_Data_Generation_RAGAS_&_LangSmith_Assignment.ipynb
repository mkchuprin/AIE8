Generative AI is flexible and used both at work and outside work. Users seek to produce writing, software code, spreadsheets, and other digital products, distinguishing generative AI from traditional web search engines. Additionally, AI serves either as co-workers producing output or as co-pilots giving advice to improve human problem-solving productivity. There is also use in self-expression areas such as relationships, personal reflection, games, and role play, though these represent a smaller portion of usage. Overall, people use AI to ask questions, perform tasks, and express themselves, spanning professional, creative, and personal domains.'"
